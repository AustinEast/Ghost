# ghost
A 2D Game Framework written in Haxe.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AustinEast/ghost.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AustinEast/ghost)

## About
Currently in rapid development, so it is not recommended for use yet.

<!-- 
## Features

## Getting Started
### Install
* Install the latest version of [Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/)
* Install preferred app framework - [OpenFL](https://www.openfl.org) or [Heaps](https://heaps.io)
* Install `ghost` and its dependencies through haxelib. The git version is recommended:
```
haxelib git ghost https://github.com/AustinEast/ghost.git
```
* Install [Ogmo Editor 3](https://ogmo-editor-3.github.io) (Optional, but recommended)
* TODO - explain how to create a project (grab template from github, eventually cli tool?)

## Usage
See `demo` for a Heaps example, and `sample` for an OpenFL example

### Concepts

#### Game

#### Entities

#### Layers

#### Levels

#### GameStates

#### Components

#### Systems

### Project Structure
- assets (`res/` if using Heaps)
  - default .ogmo project
  - default level (maybe? itd be cool to be able to press play immediately in Ogmo)
- src
  - entity folder
  - component folder
  - system folder
  - default Boot.hx

### Flow
- explain workflows
- editing the Ogmo project, how it correlates to Layers (create a layer), Entity generation (create an entity with naming conventions)
- loading levels
- move to gameplay coding - simple game-level update loop, then a custom Entity, then a component + system (maybe suuppper basic platformer?)
- different game states - game over state?
